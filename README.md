### About MeðŸ‘‹
I am a Third Year Computer Science Undergraduate at Dayananda Sagar University, Bangalore.
Recently I was employed as a Research Intern at Lykiq Labs where I was implementing artificial fish-swarm algorithm and scheduling techniques in Python.
Additionally I was also working at ShapeAI as a Machine Learning Intern (+Mentor) where I was learning and implementing Neural Machine Translation and various Deep Learning models using pytorch and keras.
I have done various projects on Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
Presently I hold the Master rank at MachineHack.

Fun Fact : I love creating UI/UX designs in Flutter!

Currently, I am diving into the world of React and Flutter by building some cool and unique projects. I am exploring more in UI/UX and product development as well on the side.
